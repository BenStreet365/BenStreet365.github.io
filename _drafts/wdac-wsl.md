# App Control for Business ü§ù Windows Subsystem for Linux
## Getting started

This is something I got working for myself just a couple of weeks ago. I use this combination daily to work with OpenTofu in an Ubuntu WSL instance. SysAdmins and Developers can often battle head to head on managing their devices, and I think this provides the best of both worlds. Local compute and still backed by the security of ACfB.

A mild disclaimer being I'm not a software developer. The needs of true developers are likely far more complex than this, but this implementation at least should get things moving in the right direction.
