# Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) for regular humans
## Getting started

WDAC is a similar technology to Windows AppLocker. I say similar, as the two systems exist side-by-side currently and can even be used together. This post is to help SysAdmins to get started with WDAC. WDAC stores its config with C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\CiPolicies\Active. Here you will find all of the CIP files currently in place for your system. Even on a fresh build, there will be entries in here - Microsoft use these to block particularly hazardous files.

WDAC is **really** powerful. You can brick your machine with little to no effort, so I really must stress that you need to test your policies well. WDAC allows you to restrict what applications you can run on your business machines. As an example, if you're rolling out Microsoft Edge and you want to insist on your staff not downloading Google Chrome (correct move, by the way) then with well configured WDAC policy you can do exactly that. Looping back to that first comment though - you can also block Microsoft applications so... take that as a warning.

I'm going to repeat myself, **test this before rolling out to any machines - even your own**. Moving on!

## WDAC Wizard

A great place to start is the [WDAC Wizard](https://aka.ms/wdacwizard){:target="_blank"}. You might be like me, where you'd rather do this in PowerShell or manually. In this instance I would strongly suggest sticking to the wizard to start with.

## Building the Base policy

Your scenario may be different but companies I support always use Microsoft technologies such as Teams. Open up WDAC Wizard, select 'Policy Creator'. Leave Multiple Policy Format and Base policy selected, then click next.

I tend to use 'Allow Microsoft mode', but it's best to use what is best for your scenario. In some lightly managed instances, the right hand option with the [ISG](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/use-wdac-with-intelligent-security-graph#how-does-wdac-work-with-the-isg){:target="_blank"} could be enough without any other policies needed.

The next page we select what additional features in WDAC we should use. The changes I make from the defaults are 'Disable script enforcement', 'Managed Installer', and 'Require WHQL'.

- Disable script enforcement - this puts PowerShell into [Restricted Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_language_modes?view=powershell-5.1#restrictedlanguage-mode){:target="_blank"}
- Managed Installer - this adds Intune as a trusted source for applications
- Require WHQL - this requires WHQL drivers to be signed to run

You will also need to turn Audit mode off, if you're planning to test the functionality.

Additional options can be seen in more detail [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/select-types-of-rules-to-create#table-1-windows-defender-application-control-policy---policy-rule-options){:target="_blank"}.

With this default **Base** policy configuration, and checking the boxes to take in the other Microsoft recommendations, you've got a solid foundation in place that will allow a newly imaged to work without additional software. When you complete the wizard, you will be provided with an XML and CIP file. 

> There is currently a flaw in this method, where your users can bypass winget and Microsoft Store blocks by going to https://apps.microsoft.com. I will update this post in the future to block these too.
{: .prompt-tip }

## Building the Supplemental policy

In a perfect world, we would be done here but we've got other things to allow through. A good place to start is allowing the entire Program Files folders through. This sounds less damaging than it really is. To be able to write to either of the Program Files folders, you need to be an Administrator on the device. It has been long accepted within the Security industry that if you have local Administrator to a device, it is game over anyway. You will save yourself considerable effort by simply allowing these folders.

To accomodate this, we're going to make a **Supplemental** Policy. This is where things may start to sound confusing but here's a shortened summary. The Base policy (highlighted above that we made earlier), is the default denial policy. Technically, it blocks pretty much everything except certain Microsoft technologies. These Supplemental policies are **exceptions** to the Base policy. This is what *you* as the Administrator are saying Windows is allowed to run as well as its base policy requirements. A Supplemental policy refers to the Base policy ID for the two to mesh together.

So, open up WDAC Wizard again and this time create a Supplemental policy. You will need to browse to the Base Policy, or provide the Base Policy GUID (found within the XML created). When creating a Supplemental policy, you'll notice everything is a lot less crowded. We're essentially starting with a clean slate. 

![WDAC5](/assets/wdac-part1/wdac5.png)

For this policy, add in "C:\Program Files\\\*" and "C:\Program Files (x86)\\\*". When you are done, you'll have your two sets of policy files. 

## Testing and wrapping up

You now have your Base and Supplemental policies. A quick and easy way to test these policies is using a Windows 11 VM, or even Windows Sandbox. I would suggest the VM route in this instance for a more realistic machine. Take the two CIP files that were created from our policies, and drop them in C:\Windows\System32\CodeIntegrity\CiPolicies\Active. These policies work quite fast and don't require a reboot - but I reboot anyway. 

![WDAC6](/assets/wdac-part1/wdac6.png)

A quick and easy test is to go and download Google Chrome to see if it runs. If all has gone to plan, then you should get a big error saying that WDAC has blocked the file from running. If you do, Congratulations! Best move on to [Part 2]({% post_url 2024-06-15-wdac-part2 %}) which will be coming soon.
